`To talk about an electron that is both spin up and spin right is nonsensical.'

\begin{definition}
    \emph{Tunneling} is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where an object on the quantum scale can penetrate barriers in a manner that's contradictory to what classical mechanics predicts. In other words, an object can sometimes move through something that should seemingly stop its movement.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \emph{Quantum decoherence} is when the wave function that describes the quantum state of a particle `collapses' (ie, the quantum state can no longer be predicted or described by the wave function). With decoherence, information about the system is lost into the environment; if a quantum system were perfectly isolated (ie, if nothing could interact with it), it would maintain coherence indefinitely.
\end{definition}

With $n$ qubits, a quantum algorithm can search up to $2^n$ states simultaneously. This is the advantage of quantum computers--modelling complex systems and searching through a large set of possibilities is where quantum computers can be useful.
